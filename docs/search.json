    "text": "Overall, respondents from Southeast Asian countries felt less confident about being equally valued compared to their Western or high-income country research colleagues (Values & Behaviours 2). They also reported lower scores on questions regarding whether their mental and physical health needs are adequately supported (Mental health), whether they are fairly compensated for the time dedicated to research (Knowledge-do gap 3) and whether they have sufficient time in their daily schedules to conduct research (Knowledge-do gap 4). Respondents from Indonesia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam expressed low confidence in their English proficiency, which they felt could hinder their ability to conduct research (Knowledge-do gap 2).

Research assistants and research health professionals expressed concerns that their mental or physical health needs were not adequately supported (Mental health), and they also worried that limited English proficiency may affect their experience in conducting research (Knowledge–Do Gap 2).

They were also uncertain whether the research funding their organisation receives reflects national or contextual priorities (Policies & Practice 5), and they did not believe their institution offers specific programmes to support new academics in starting their research or developing core skills such as academic writing, literature review, and data analysis (Resources 2). Research support staff, lecturers, and assistant professors felt that their organisation prioritises other activities over research (Policies & Practice 2). Students, lecturers, assistant professors, and senior faculty members reported that their institution lacks sufficient resources to conduct quality research (Resources 1). Additionally, students and lecturers felt there were not enough initiatives to support new or junior researchers in securing initial grants or publications (Resources 3).\n\n\nInter-institutional level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents and research assistants were less likely to agree that they had an overall positive experience collaborating on research projects with institutions outside Southeast Asia (Relationship between organisations 2)."
